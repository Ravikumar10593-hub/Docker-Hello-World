## What is Docker?

![alt text](asset/image.png)

In simple words, docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications using containers.

**Benefits of Docker:**

- **Fast Delivery**: Docker streamlines the development lifecycle, reducing the delay between writing code and running it in production.
- **Portability**: Containers can run on laptops, data centers, cloud providers, or a mix of environments. They‚Äôre highly portable and lightweight.
- **Scalability**: Docker allows dynamic management of workloads, scaling applications up or down as needed.
- **Efficiency**: Containers use server capacity more effectively than traditional virtual machines.

## Difference between containerization and virtualization

```
| Aspect         | Containerization                                  | Virtualization                                |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Isolation      | Uses OS-level isolation, sharing the host kernel  | Provides full isolation, each VM has its OS   |
| Resource Usage | Lightweight, shares host resources efficiently    | Relatively heavier, requires more resources   |
| Performance    | Generally higher performance due to less overhead | Slightly lower performance due to abstraction |
| Startup Time   | Faster startup times                              | Slower startup times                          |
| Dependency     | Application-centric dependencies                  | OS-centric dependencies                       |
| Portability    | Highly portable across environments               | Portable but may require more configuration   |
| Maintenance    | Easier to maintain due to fewer components        | More complex maintenance due to multiple OSes |
| Scalability    | Easier to scale horizontally                      | Can be more resource-intensive to scale       |
```

## What is Dockerfile, Image, and Container?

![alt text](asset/image-1.png)

- **Dockerfile**: A text file containing instructions to build a Docker image.
- **Docker Image**: A lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.
- **Docker Container**: An instance of a Docker image that runs a software application and encapsulates its dependencies.

## Step by Step Process to create the Docker project

1. Create a Directory ‚ÄúDocker-Hello-World‚Äù
2. Open the Folder/ Choose the folder in VS code or any IDE you are using.

3. We have to create 2 files:
   
![alt text](asset/image-3.png)

- `app.py`: This is going to be our Python file with only one line of code.
```
print("hello World")
```
- **Dockerfile** (This name is case sensitive and without any extension): This file will have all the step-by-step process of how we are going to ship this project and what all the commands will be executed.

```
FROM python
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
CMD ["python", "app.py"]


# FROM python -sets the base image as an official Python image.

# WORKDIR /app -changes the working directory to /app inside the container.

# COPY . /app -copies the contents of the current directory into the /app directory within the container.

# CMD [‚Äúpython‚Äù, ‚Äúapp.py‚Äù] -specifies that the app.py script should be executed using the Python interpreter when a container is started.

```
4. Keep your Docker Desktop app up and running

5. Now follow the commands to build the image

![alt text](asset/image-5.png)

- Build the Docker image: Open the VS code terminal and follow along
  
```
docker build -t dockerhelloworld .
```

- `docker build`: Command used to build Docker images from a Dockerfile.
- `-t dockerhelloworld`: Tag option used to assign a name and optionally a tag to the Docker image being built (in this case, "dockerhelloworld").
- `.`: Here .represents the current directory.

6. To run the image you can use two ways.

![alt text](asset/image-7.png)

- **First**: Go to the Docker desktop and run the container (See the GIF below)

![alt text](asset/image-8.png)

- **Second**: Using VS Code Terminal:

```
docker run dockerhelloworld
```

## Conclusion

In this post, we covered multiple topics in Docker like containerization and virtualization, and a step-by-step guide on how to run your first ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù Python program in a Docker container.
